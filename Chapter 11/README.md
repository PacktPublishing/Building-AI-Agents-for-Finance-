# Chapter 11 — Evaluating AI Agents in Finance

Companion code for Chapter 11: a complete evaluation harness for the
KYC onboarding agent the chapter specifies as its system under test.
The harness runs in CI on every commit, captures production traces,
calibrates an LLM-as-a-judge against human labels, detects drift, and
produces a model risk report. A deterministic mock of the KYC pipeline
ships with the harness, so everything runs end to end out of the box;
an adapter hook lets you plug in a real implementation.

```

## Quickstart

```bash
cd "Chapter 11"
pip install -e .
python -m src.eval_harness.run --segment all --output scorecard.json
```

The harness will load every case from `data/kyc_eval/`, run the KYC
agent on each (using the bundled deterministic mock unless a real
pipeline is installed — see below), compute every metric in
`scorecard.yaml`, and write a JSON scorecard plus a Markdown summary.
With the mock, the full run ends `ship_decision=SHIP` with every
catastrophic gate passing, so a green baseline is reproducible before
you wire in a real agent.

The exit code is `0` if every catastrophic-severity metric passes its
threshold and the weighted score is `>= 0.85`; nonzero otherwise. CI
uses this as the production-promotion gate.

## With a real KYC pipeline

If you have implemented the chapter's KYC pipeline (for example, by
following the sequential multi-agent pattern from Chapters 7 and 9)
and installed it as a Python package named `chapter09.kyc_pipeline`,
`src/kyc_pipeline_adapter.py` will import it automatically. Otherwise
the adapter falls back to a deterministic mock that exercises every
metric in the harness.

## Calibrating the LLM-judge

```bash
python -c "
from src.calibration.judge_calibration import (
    load_calibration_set, inter_rater_reliability)
items = load_calibration_set()
print('inter-rater kappa:', inter_rater_reliability(items))
"
```

Recommended workflow:
1. Confirm human inter-rater kappa is `>= 0.7` (otherwise refine the rubric)
2. Run the LLM-judge on the calibration cases
3. Compute judge-vs-human kappa
4. Iterate the rubric in `src/eval_harness/llm_judge_metrics.py:GROUNDING_RUBRIC`
   until kappa hits 0.7
5. Freeze the rubric, judge model, and calibration set as a versioned
   regulatory artifact

## Drift detection

```python
import numpy as np
from src.continuous.drift_detector import detect_drift

baseline = np.array([0.92, 0.88, 0.94, 0.90, 0.91, ...])  # offline judge scores
current  = np.array([0.81, 0.79, 0.83, 0.78, 0.80, ...])  # production sample

result = detect_drift(baseline, current)
print(result.explain())
```

## Generating the model risk report

```bash
python -m src.eval_harness.run --output scorecard.json
python -m src.reporting.model_risk_report scorecard.json --out report.md
pandoc report.md -o model_risk_report.pdf
```

## Notes

- **Mock vs real KYC agent.** The system under test is the KYC
  onboarding agent specified in the chapter itself. Chapter 9 builds
  insurance workflows (claims processing, fraud investigation,
  underwriting), not KYC, so no ready-made implementation exists in
  the book's code — building one from the chapter's specification,
  following the Chapter 7/9 pipeline patterns, is the natural exercise.
  Until then the adapter uses the deterministic mock; swap the import
  in `kyc_pipeline_adapter.py` to evaluate a real implementation.
- **Sample dataset size.** Each segment ships with 5–6 representative
  cases — enough to exercise the harness end-to-end, not enough for a
  production scorecard. The chapter’s The KYC evaluation dataset
  structure section describes the ~2,050-case full dataset
  construction.
- **API keys.** Without `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` set,
  the LLM-judge metric falls back to a heuristic that counts how many
  expected tool names are mentioned in the reasoning chain. Useful for
  smoke-testing the harness; not a substitute for a calibrated judge.
